# mirthsync

Mirthsync is a command line tool for keeping a local copy of important
aspects of Mirth Connect configuration in order to allow for the use
of traditional version control tools like Git or SVN. Downloading and
uploading to a remote Mirth server are both supported. The only
requirements are having credentials for the server that is being
synced and the server also needs to support and allow access to the
REST API.
