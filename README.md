# Mirthsync

Mirthsync is a command line tool for synchronizing Mirth Connect code
between servers by allowing you to push or pull channels, code
templates, configuration map and global scripts. The tool can also be
integrated with Git or other version control systems for the purpose
of tracking changes to Mirth Connect code and configuration. 

The only requirements are having credentials for the server that is
being synced and the server also needs to support and allow access to
Mirth Connect's REST API.

## Suggestions for use

- Use Mirthsync in conjunction with Git (or any VCS) to back up and
  track changes to code and settings
- Pull and push changes between Mirth Connect servers
- Utilize Git branches to track and merge code between dev, test, and
  prod environments

## Status
### 2.0 Release is coming soon.
The 2.0 release of Mirthsync will bring bi-directional groups
support. The 2.0.3-SNAPSHOT release is fully functional and will be
released as 2.0.3 after further testing.

## Changes
### 2.0.2-SNAPSHOT
The local directory structure has been changed to nest channels within
their respective group.

## Installation 

`$ git clone https://github.com/SagaHealthcareIT/mirthsync.git`

## Examples

### CLI

How to pull Mirth Connect code from a Mirth Connect instance:

``` shell
$ java -jar mirthsync.jar -s https://localhost:8443/api -u admin -p admin pull -t /home/user/
```
> Note that the -t paramter accepts absolute and relative paths.

Pulling code from a Mirth Connect instance allowing for overwriting existing files:

``` shell
$ java -jar mirthsync.jar -s https://localhost:8443/api -u admin -p admin -f pull -t /home/user/
```
Pushing code to a Mirth Connect instance (doesn't have to be the same
instance that was pulled from):

``` shell
$ java -jar mirthsync.jar -s https://otherserver.localhost/api -u admin -p admin push -t /home/user/
```
### Cron

There is a sample script (git-cron-sample.sh) packaged that can be
customized and utilized from a cron job and/or the command line. The
script can take an optional commit message in cases where it is
desirable to immediately pull and commit changes to git with
meaningful commit messages.

Sample crontab...

``` shell
# At 02:24 on every day-of-week from Sunday through Saturday 
24 2 * * 0-6 /opt/mirthsync/git-cron-sample.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### REPL

Pull/Push from a REPL.

The following pulls code to a directory called 'tmp' (relative to the
execution environment), overwriting existing files ("-f") and ignoring
the validity of the server certificate ("-i"), and then pushes back to
the local server from the same directory.

``` clj
(mirthsync.core/-main "-s" "https://localhost:8443/api" "-u" "admin" "-p" "admin" "-t" "target/tmp" "-f" "-i" "pull")
(mirthsync.core/-main "-s" "https://localhost:8443/api" "-u" "admin" "-p" "admin" "-t" "target/tmp" "-f" "-i" "push")
```

## Build from Source

Requires [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

`$ lein uberjar`

## Todo

- Add the ability to selectively push or pull any channel, group,
  script, etc
- Add granular extraction of scripts into their own files and merge
  back into XML for pushing
